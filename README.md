# calculator-app
 
Hello,

Here is my custom, basic calculator that I programed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project was my first, more complex JavaSript project. I wanted to push myself and test my knowledge on the JavaScript content I had learned so far. Therefore, no tutorials were used to create this. The only resources I used were Stack Overflow for little things that I got caught up on.

Here is the final outcome!
